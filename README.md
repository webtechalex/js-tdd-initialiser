# Javascript TDD Boilerplate Initialiser
A very simple bash script to quickly create an environment for running and testing ES6 Javascript code with Jest.

Just run the script with a name for your project and `cd` into the newly created project folder once the script finishes running. Then add your preferred Jest script to the `"test"` field in package.json
Create your first test then run your test script:
```
npm run test
```
